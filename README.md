# savepagenow_client

This is work in progress Python wrapper for archive.orgâ€™s Save Page Now API.

The is deeply inspired by [palewire/savepagenow](https://github.com/palewire/savepagenow) library. The [palewire/savepagenow](https://github.com/palewire/savepagenow) library only calls the save endpoint. If you want to access status, outlinks, and first_archive, you need to call the status endpoint as well.

This will increase the complexity of the library, as we will need to wait until the request is processed.

I am currently dogfooding the API, and it not currently stable. If you don't need these attributes, you should use the [palewire/savepagenow](https://github.com/palewire/savepagenow) library.
